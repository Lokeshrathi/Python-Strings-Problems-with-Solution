# Python-Strings-Problems-with-Solution

## Solved few String related Problems using Python:

1. **Is Unique**: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
2. **Check Palindrome** : Given 2 strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other
3. **URLify** : Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold additional characters.
4. **String Comprehension** : Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For ex: "aaaabbccc" -> "a4b2c3"
